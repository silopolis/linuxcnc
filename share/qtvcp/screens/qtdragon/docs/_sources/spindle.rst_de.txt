QtDragon was designed to interface to a VFD, but will work without it for simulation purposes. 
There are a number of VFD drivers included in the linuxcnc distribution, including hy_gt_vfd and mb2hal. A custom HAL component has been
created for use with QtDragon, called hy_gt_vfd.py (same name as the linuxcnc version)
The following is an example of what must be added to the qtdragon_postgui.hal file:

.. code-block:: python

  loadusr -Wn gt_vfd ./hy_gt_vfd.py -d /dev/ttyUSB0
  net spindle-on           gt_vfd.spindle-on <= spindle.0.on
  net spindle-rps          gt_vfd.speed-fb => spindle.0.speed-in
  net spindle-rps          near.0.in1
  net spindle-amps         gt_vfd.output-amps => qtdragon.spindle_amps
  net spindle-volts        gt_vfd.output-volts => qtdragon.spindle_volts
  net spindle-fault        gt_vfd.fault-info => qtdragon.spindle_fault
  net spindle-cmd          gt_vfd.speed-cmd <= spindle.0.speed-out-abs
  net spindle-cmd-rps      near.0.in2 <= spindle.0.speed-out-rps
  net spindle-pause        qtdragon.spindle_pause => spindle.0.inhibit
  net modbus-errors        gt_vfd.modbus-errors => qtdragon.modbus-errors
  net at-speed             near.0.out => and2.0.in0
  net spindle-fwd          spindle.0.forward => and2.0.in1
  net at-speed-fwd         spindle.0.at-speed <= and2.0.out

This will vary according to the particular machine configuration.

.. note:: The hy_gt_vfd.py module requires the library package minimalmodbus to be installed. (https://minimalmodbus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

When a running program is paused, the SPINDLE PAUSE button is enabled. When clicked, it will cause the spindle to stop and the Z axis will
move up by a distance determined by the EOFFSET value in the SETTINGS page. This allows the operator to clear chips or whatever without 
having the spindle running. When ready to resume, press the SPINDLE PAUSE button again and note the popup dialog warning to wait for the spindle
to resume speed before pressing the RESUME button. If the LED on the SPINDLE PAUSE button lights up, it means the Z axis didn't move the
full distance due to axis travel limitations. ie. Zmin
