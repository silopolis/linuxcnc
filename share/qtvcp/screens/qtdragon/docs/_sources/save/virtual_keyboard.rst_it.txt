VIRTUAL KEYBOARD
================
QtDragon includes a virtual keyboard for use with touchscreens.
To enable the keyboard, check the Use Virtual Keyboard checkbox in the Settings page.
Clicking on any input field, such as probe parameters or tool table entries, will show the keyboard.
It can also be shown by clicking the KEYBD button on the top of the screen,
unless the machine is in AUTO mode. To hide the keyboard, do one of the following:
- click the MAIN page button
- click the KEYBD button - go into AUTO mode

It should be noted that keyboard jogging is disabled when using the virtual keyboard.
