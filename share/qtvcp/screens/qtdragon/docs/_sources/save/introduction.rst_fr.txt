INTRODUCTION
============
QtDragon is built with the QTVCP framework. Much of it is based on the excellent work of others in the LinuxCNC community.
It's primary intended use is to provide an example of what can be created with qtvcp and qt designer, but is suitable for use on small 
CNC machines running linuxcnc as the controller software.

.. note:: QtDragon and QtVcp are new programs added into linuxcnc. Bugs and oddities are possible. Please test carefully when using a dangerous machine. Please forward reports to the forum or maillist.
