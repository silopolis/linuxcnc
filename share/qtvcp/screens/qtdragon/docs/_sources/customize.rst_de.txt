CUSTOMIZATION
=============
All aspects of the GUI are fully customizable through qtdesigner. 
This is included with the qtvcp development environment. The extensive use of qtvcp widgets keeps the amount
of required python code to a minimum, allowing relatively easy modifications. 
The LinuxCNC website has extensive documentation on the installation and use of qtvcp libraries. 
See QtVCP Overview at http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.8/html/gui/qtvcp.html for more information.
