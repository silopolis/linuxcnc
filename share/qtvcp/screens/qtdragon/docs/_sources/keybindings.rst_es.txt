KEYBINDINGS
===========

QtDragon is not intended to primarily use a keyboard for machine control.
There are several key presses that will control the machine for convenience.

- F1 - Estop on/off
- F2 - Machine on/off
- F12 - Style Editor
- Home - Home All Joints of the Machine
- Escape - Abort Movement
- Pause -Pause Machine Movement

It is not always desirable to use keyboard jogging, such as while editing gcode files. Keyboard jogging can be enabled or disabled
with a checkbox on the SETTINGS page.
